# Update the BDcenter directory from GitHub

+++
---

When new Docker containers will be available, you need to update the BDcenter directory. To do that, move to your BDcenter directory:

```
    cd ~/BDcenter
```

And run the command below when you are inside the BDcenter directory:

```
    git pull
```

This command **erases** all your local changes to the docker-compose files.
